<div class = "border"><p id = "two">
I was born in ottawa ontario and for the most part raised by my grandparents
in luninburg ontario and for a short time I had lived in edmonton alberta with
my mother but i retured here to ontario. In my 19 years of life ive seen almost
the whole of this contery a small portion of the USA and Ive seen spain in
Europe. Growing up I lived a mostly normal life I was never vary good in school
until i came back from the west then i Got high marks in every thing but math
Im vary bad at math and i mean vary bad its jest math isent my thing my brain
overcomplacates it. Growing up I watched my father play video games when I was
at his house and thats what got me into video games and well here i am in game
programing and thats my story.
